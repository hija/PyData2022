# Dask

![](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/_images/dask_horizontal.svg)

Dask is an open source library for parallel computing written in Python. Dask is especially interesting for me, since it has almost the same interfaces as pandas DataFrames and can be used with scikit-learn (the library I use most often for machine learning).

Dask makes it very easy to do parallel computing - either on multiple cores on one CPU or distributed, e.g. on a cluster.
