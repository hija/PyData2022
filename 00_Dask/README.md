# Dask

![](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/_images/dask_horizontal.svg)

Dask is an **open source** (BSD 3 licensed) library for parallel computing written in Python. Dask is especially interesting for me, since it has almost the same interfaces as pandas DataFrames and can be used with scikit-learn (the library I use most often for machine learning).

Dask makes it very easy to do parallel computing - either on multiple cores on one CPU or distributed, e.g. on a cluster.

These are the talks / tutorials I watched regarding Dask:
